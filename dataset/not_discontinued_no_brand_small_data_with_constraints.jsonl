The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different. The edges aren't finished, like a plate with no backing, but I don't think it would cause anyone to slice their finger open unless you're being extremely careless.<br /><br />All in all a great set. | Plates work great with other stamper. Having a hard time getting the stamp to pick up. Plates work great with other stamper. | Love it!. Does the work. Its good for the price. I wish it came in a better presentantion for gifts but its ok. | The plates alone are more than worth the price.. This is such a good deal!

All the designs I have tried so far (most of them) have been well etched. The plates have sturdy plastic backings that extend slightly beyond the edges so you can grasp them without worrying about getting cut.  It's nice to have such a variety of different style designs to work with.The scraper is credit card style, which I like, but it is a little thinner and more flexible than I am used to using. I like a bit more body than this one has. Still it is usable. The stamper is small but nice. I like the transparent style so I can see where I am placing an image. I had a little trouble picking up polish with it at first, so I primed it by repeatedly stamping it on a lint roller, and now it works just fine. All in all, I would say this could be an excellent starter kit for anyone wanting to try nail stamping.<br /><br />The template with cutouts is something I hadn't tried before. The way it works is that you apply polish to the stamping plate and scrape it. Then lay the template on the stamping plate, and stamp on/through the opening. You need a fairly soft stamp for this to  press down through the opening. (The one in this kit works fine.) Then you stamp your nail. You have to work fairly quickly to get it placed after scraping the polish (or use polish that dries slowly), but it does work.. I will  say that the cut out areas are a little bit on the large side for my not too long nails. It might be fun to try using it to make decals, but I haven't gotten so far as trying that yet.<br /><br />So as a starter kit, or to expand your plate collection I would recommend this item.

What's inside? -RED Tattoo Stencil- A revolutionary red freehand and thermal stencil paper. -RED Stencil Transfer Gel- Prepares and cleans the skin, then acts as a transfer medium. -RED Tattooing Gel- A gel that improves ink saturation, needle performance and reduces inflammation. S8 proudly introduces the RED Tattoo Stencil Transfer System. A new beginning. The first ever red-colored freehand and thermal ready stencil paper. The first ever stencil transfer gel that prepares and protects the skin. The first ever tattooing gel that seals the stencil to the skin and creates a near zero-degree coefficient of drag. All designed to work perfectly in tandem. About the Artist: Russ Abbott is a pioneer. Since he began his tattooing career in 1997, Abbott has become a leader in the American Illustrative tattooing movement. But Abbott is not an easy artist to classify. His tattoos are spectacular pastiches, incorporating subjects from literature and American folk art, baroque stylistic flourishes, and sacred geometries. The constant in Abbott’s work is his understanding and application of color theory. The scope of his palette is evident in many of his large illustrative pieces, which demonstrate both his eye for color and his tremendous technical aptitude. Abbott has also been a vocal advocate for the role of digital design and layout in tattooing. He does much of his tattoo design work- from mandalas to outdoor scenes- on computers and has proven the role of software in visualizing tattoos on the body. Abbott owns and tattoos out of Ink & Dagger Tattoo in Georgia, and travels internationally to educate fellow tattooers as well as the general public."], "categories": [], "bought_together": null, "generated": {"intents": ["Looking for red tattoo stencil paper", "Need a full tattoo transfer kit", "Best gels for tattoo ink application", "Searching for reliable tattoo transfer system", "Tattoo stencil sheets with good reviews"], "constraints": [{"rating_min": 2}], "raw_text": "```json\n{\n  \"intents\": [\n    \"Looking for red tattoo stencil paper\",\n    \"Need a full tattoo transfer kit\",\n    \"Best gels for tattoo ink application\",\n    \"Searching for reliable tattoo transfer system\",\n    \"Tattoo stencil sheets with good reviews\"\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"rating_min\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"}}

It lasts ALL DAY and BONUS: it doesn't look like a mask because it's actually the right color!!!<br /><br />I was having some issues in the beginning with it separating on my skin after about an hour (mostly on my T-zone), but it hasn't been doing this since I changed setting powders (originally, I was using Too Faced's Prepped and Primed, which is a fine product that I love, but on my skin it doesn't seem compatible with my foundation when I add Zero Minus).

The blue part of the sponge goes in your hand and the black part of the sponge goes towards your hair. There are small-medium sized holes in the sponge.
