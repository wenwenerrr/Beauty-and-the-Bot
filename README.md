# Beauty-and-the-Bot
In the increasingly competitive e-commerce industry, customer satisfaction and personalized engagement are critical to brand loyalty. With a wide and diverse customer base, handling large volumes of product inquiries and after-sales questions efficiently has become increasingly important. To address this need, our project develops an intelligent customer service chatbot designed specifically for the Beauty category.

Our approach combines a two-stage knowledge-graph-augmented multimodal recommendation system with LLM, and deploy QLoRA Fine-tuning on LLAMA model. Through this, we aim to create a chatbot that is fast, reliable, and aligned with industrial Beauty’s customer service standards.
